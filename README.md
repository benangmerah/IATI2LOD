IATI2LOD
========

Scripts for converting IATI data to RDF.

Originally by Kasper Brandt, ported to Node.js from Python by Andhika Nugraha.

Goals:
 - Implement original conventions for converting IATI to RDF.
 - Return RDF Graph in line with the [RDF Interfaces](http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf-interfaces/) spec, using [node-rdf](https://github.com/Acubed/node-rdf).
